The data set chosen consists of all crimes reported by the Boston Police Department in Boston from the year 2015 to date

• Type of crime committed
• Time when the crime was committed • Locationofthecrime
• Whether a shooting was involved etc.

This project predominantly has two aims

1. How the factors such as area and Time affect the crime rate in the city
2. Predict the monthly count of crimes
