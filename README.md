# Boston-Crime-Analysis

This GitHub repository presents an in-depth analysis of crime data in Boston from 2015 onwards, reported by the Boston Police Department. The project's main objectives are to explore how various factors such as area and time affect the crime rate in the city and to predict future crime occurrences using machine learning models.

## Key aspects of the project include:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Combining multiple datasets and handling missing data, utilizing Pythonâ€™s Geopy package for accurate location data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing trends and patterns in the data, including plotting heat maps to visualize the distribution of crimes across Boston.
* **Time-Series Modeling:** Using ARIMA and SARIMA models to predict monthly crime counts, analyzing seasonality and trends, and calculating Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for model evaluation.
* **Impact and Future Work:** Helping various stakeholders like police, residents, and students to make better-informed decisions regarding safety and housing, and potential improvements to increase the accuracy and specificity of predictions.

This project serves as a resource for law enforcement and residents to understand and anticipate crime trends, ultimately aiding in resource allocation and safety planning.
